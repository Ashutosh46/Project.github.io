Aim - The main aim of the project is to predict customer lifetime value using various features.

Project Description-
1. Finding missing Values
2. Listing out the Numerical Variables
3. Distribution of the Numerical Variables
4. Categorical Variables
5. Cardinality of Categorical Variables
6. Encoding
7. Splitting the data.
8. Scaling.
9. Modeling the data
10. Testing the data.

Installation -   
This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- seaborn   
- TensorFlow  
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.  
If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

Usage -   
For a company to make strategic business decisions, it is very important to recognise it's potential customers. By using this model one can know how much a customer can benefit an insurance company. So accordingly the business and revenue model can be created to profit its business.
